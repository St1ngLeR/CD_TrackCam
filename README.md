# Crashday 1.2 - Free Track Cam
An ASI plugin enable free track camera activation for making screenshots in Crashday 1.2 (2006).

## Install & usage
To make ASI plugin work in the game you need to use [ThirteenAG's Ultimate ASI Loader](https://github.com/ThirteenAG/Ultimate-ASI-Loader) and put plugin files in to game directory or folders mentioned in ThirteenAG's loader GitHub page.

Before running the game it's highly recommended to check the `CDTrackCam.ini` file at first. This config file contains key bindings for camera controls that you can change.

For key values check the `inpnamdx.lst` file from the `gametext` folder. If you don't have this file, you can check the DirectInput key codes, they are identical.

Default free track cam keys:

Activation - End (`0xCF`)\
Move Mode - Q (`0x10`)\
Zoom Mode - E (`0x12`)\
Move In/Out - ~ (`0x29`)\
Up - W (`0x11`)\
Left - A (`0x1E`)\
Right - D (`0x20`)\
Down - S (`0x1F`)
